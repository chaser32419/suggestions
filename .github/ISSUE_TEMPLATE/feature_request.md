**Before adding a new feature request, please, make sure youâ€™ve checked:**


- if the feature is already added to the backlog or in work;
- if the feature is missing from the products.

**Please, describe the feature request, making it clear to understand.**

- Being able to go directly to checkout on a popup would make things more streamlined for customers. 
- Using something like woobuilder or jetengine listing to create a custom product or post layout someone could add a dynamic popup to a button where users are able to click on a specific tip/donation or enter their own into it and have the chekcout process be done right there so they can continue to explore the store.


**Add an example of where this feature is already implemented. **

More and more companies, store owners, and bloggers are wanting to have a tip/donate option and being able to add that to their already exsiting woocommerce store would make it easier for them to handle processing and motioring where their money is coming from. They're wanting something like onlyfans. 
 
Here is a link to a plugin that already does it but I believe your company could do more with it.
